      Our story began in Singapore in March 2018. It was an idea for traveling entrepreneurs and digital nomads to have a relaxed yet productive work space, while on the quest to conquer the world. The overwhelming positive response soon morphed into a movement and crystallized into our mission to enable the startup of one million businesses worldwide.<br /><br />In 2019 (2020) we joined forces with the Draper Ecosystem to form Draper Startup House. This made the pursuit of making hospitality the foundation of an entrepreneurial ecosystem, a sustainable reality. Soon thereafter, we opened the first US Draper Startup House in Austin, Texas.<br /><br />Draper Startup House hostels are a place where traveling startups, digital nomads and the creative and entrepreneurial community can gather to connect with diverse-minded people, inspire each other to create new ventures that are empowered to grow. Through startup events, networking and funding opportunities, and a unique amount of local and global connections, we enable businesses, and Draper Startup House to thrive, to give back to our communities, and to drive progress — together.
